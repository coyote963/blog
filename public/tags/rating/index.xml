      <description>How do you compare rating algorithms? Or more generally, what is an objective measure of the accuracy of a predictor?
The Motivation I run ratings on a team based shooter called Boring Man, and I&#39;ve always wanted to be able to rank the players in terms of their skills. In fact I believe my first encounters with hobby programming were because of this game.
In previous iterations of my projects, I had always used the Elo rating scheme to adjust player&#39;s ratings, but this time I decided to experiment more and use the TrueSkill rating system by the people at Microsoft.</description>
