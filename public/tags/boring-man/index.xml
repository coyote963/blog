      <description>Documenting the process of creating a discord bot.
So I wanted a discord bot&amp;hellip; All these times, I have seen people talking about discord bots and using them to do all sorts of amazing things, I have felt left in the dark because the last time I tried using discord.py&#39;s library I failed to wrap my head around everything.
That was a time when my ambitions didn&#39;t measure against my ability to read documentation.</description>

      <description>Welcome to my blog A little about me: I am a person who is interested in statistics and data visualization. I enjoy seeing data represented in interesting ways. Data is beautiful.
I am also very interested in software craftmanship, making high quality code and discovering what are the best design principles.
When you put these two interests together, it is no surprise that I am interested in writing websites that have cool graphs in them!</description>
