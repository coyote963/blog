			<description>Welcome to my blog A little about me: I am a person who is interested in statistics and data visualization. I enjoy seeing data represented in interesting ways. Data is beautiful.
I am also very interested in software craftmanship, making high quality code and discovering what are the best design principles.
When you put these two interests together, it is no surprise that I am interested in writing websites that have cool graphs in them!</description>

<p>A little about me: I am a person who is interested in statistics and data visualization. I enjoy seeing data represented in interesting ways. Data is beautiful.</p>
<p>I am also very interested in software craftmanship, making high quality code and discovering what are the best design principles.</p>
<p>When you put these two interests together, it is no surprise that I am interested in writing websites that have cool graphs in them!</p>
<h3 id="how-i-hope-to-use-my-blog">How I hope to use my blog</h3>
<p>I hope that this is a blog that documents my progression as a professional. I want to see how I have changed over the years and document the things that are in my head. I sometimes have many thoughts bouncing in my head and I wish to put them into writing as a way of explaining them to an imaginary person, as a way of further understanding these ideas myself.</p>
<p>I love exploring new technologies, and want to write about my progress learning them. In the future I plan to tackle machine learning, more complex data visualization and a little dev ops.</p>
<h3 id="more-specifically">More specifically&hellip;</h3>
<p>Here are some projects I have coming down the pipeline. Right now the Boring Man Rewrite is in full development, and I want to ensure that this blog reflects the excitement for the future of my beloved game!</p>
<p>I am working on projects that aim to augment the player experience. Such as:</p>
<ol>
<li>boring man discord bot</li>
<li>boring man ratings rcon script</li>
<li>boring man 1v1 automator</li>
<li>boring man casino</li>
<li>boring man boring man website dyson.city</li>
<li>boring man server host on demand</li>
</ol>
<p>Besides software development, I want to start making some content of the game</p>
<ol>
<li>map based around a certain aesthetic (dark fantasy sci-fi map) with custom tiles</li>
<li>tech video</li>
<li>map showcases</li>
<li>matches between top players</li>
</ol>
<p>Boring man may be my focus for the next few weeks but in the far future (3 months?), I know I have some projects in areas of game development and artificial intelligence I want developed.</p>
<ol>
<li>A game like mega man, grid based combat online</li>
<li>Idk anything about AI/ML but after taking a few courses I'll think of something</li>
</ol>
