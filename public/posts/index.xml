			<description>So I wanted a discord bot&amp;hellip; All these times, I have seen people talking about discord bots and using them to do all sorts of amazing things, I have felt left in the dark because the last time I tried using discord.py&#39;s library I failed to wrap my head around everything.
That was a time when my ambitions didn&#39;t measure against my ability to read documentation. This time was different, and I am proud to announce my new discord bot: Coybot</description>

<p>All these times, I have seen people talking about discord bots and using them to do all sorts of amazing things, I have felt left in the dark because the last time I tried using discord.py's library I failed to wrap my head around everything.</p>
<p>That was a time when my ambitions didn't measure against my ability to read documentation. This time was different, and I am proud to announce my new discord bot: Coybot</p>
<h1 id="how-i-made-it">How I made it</h1>
<p>Well first I was looking online for some sample projects so I could see what kind of code was boilerplate, and I could just copy. This led me to a couple libraries like <a href="https://github.com/SourSpoon/Discord.py-Template">this</a>. I noticed that this boilerplate was really extensive and seemed to be a overshoot of the small problem that I had. So then I noticed in the readme of that repo, that there was a way to generate a template for this exact purpose!</p>
<p>Great, so I did <code>python -m discord newbot coybot</code> and the bot was made! I wanted everything to be in best practices so I immediately made a cog, then ran into the issue of not being able to load the cog in with <code>load_extension(cog)</code>, thats when my shaky understanding of python's module system came back to bite me. After a few minutes of googling, I realized that</p>
<ol start="0">
<li>You don't just type the name of the cog</li>
<li>You don't load the cog object into the config.py</li>
<li>You don't type a relative path in there either</li>
</ol>
<p>Welp finally the cog had loaded and all was good!</p>
<p>Now I had code that used webhooks to send messages to my discord server, so it was really quite easy to convert that code into callable functions that simply required database clients, but that raised the final issue which was: Where was the best place to instantiate my database connection?</p>
<p>I finally put it in the <code>init</code> method, put the database uri in a secrets folder and called it a day. With some debugging everything worked fine and dandy.</p>
<h1 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h1>
<p>The groundwork for the bot has been set, I just have to hammer out a bunch of commands. With a system like cogs in place, it nicely packages everything in your filestructure. I am beginning to think how best to separate my commands, and whether that is even necessary.</p>
<p>More updates to come</p>

			<description>Welcome to my blog A little about me: I am a person who is interested in statistics and data visualization. I enjoy seeing data represented in interesting ways. Data is beautiful.
I am also very interested in software craftmanship, making high quality code and discovering what are the best design principles.
When you put these two interests together, it is no surprise that I am interested in writing websites that have cool graphs in them!</description>

<h3 id="how-i-hope-to-use-my-blog">How I hope to use my blog</h3>
<p>I hope that this is a blog that documents my progression as a professional. I want to see how I have changed over the years and document the things that are in my head. I sometimes have many thoughts bouncing in my head and I wish to put them into writing as a way of explaining them to an imaginary person, as a way of further understanding these ideas myself.</p>
<p>I love exploring new technologies, and want to write about my progress learning them. In the future I plan to tackle machine learning, more complex data visualization and a little dev ops.</p>
<h3 id="more-specifically">More specifically&hellip;</h3>
<p>Here are some projects I have coming down the pipeline. Right now the Boring Man Rewrite is in full development, and I want to ensure that this blog reflects the excitement for the future of my beloved game!</p>
<p>I am working on projects that aim to augment the player experience. Such as:</p>
<ol>
<li>boring man discord bot</li>
<li>boring man ratings rcon script</li>
<li>boring man 1v1 automator</li>
<li>boring man casino</li>
<li>boring man boring man website dyson.city</li>
<li>boring man server host on demand</li>
</ol>
<p>Besides software development, I want to start making some content of the game</p>
<ol>
<li>map based around a certain aesthetic (dark fantasy sci-fi map) with custom tiles</li>
<li>tech video</li>
<li>map showcases</li>
<li>matches between top players</li>
</ol>
<p>Boring man may be my focus for the next few weeks but in the far future (3 months?), I know I have some projects in areas of game development and artificial intelligence I want developed.</p>
<ol>
<li>A game like mega man, grid based combat online</li>
<li>Idk anything about AI/ML but after taking a few courses I'll think of something</li>
</ol>
