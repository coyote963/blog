      <description>So I wanted a discord bot&amp;hellip; All these times, I have seen people talking about discord bots and using them to do all sorts of amazing things, I have felt left in the dark because the last time I tried using discord.py&#39;s library I failed to wrap my head around everything.
That was a time when my ambitions didn&#39;t measure against my ability to read documentation. This time was different, and I am proud to announce my new discord bot: Coybot</description>

      <description>Hi there I&#39;m Yuhe, a software developer living in Ohio. I specialize in web development, but I am always looking to expand my skillset.
Right now my interests are in web development, mobile app development as well as machine learning.
Through my blog, I plan to document the various projects I am working on, challenges I face, as well as small triumphs. But most importantly I hope that the blog will help me to organize my thoughts.</description>

      <description>Welcome to my blog A little about me: I am a person who is interested in statistics and data visualization. I enjoy seeing data represented in interesting ways. Data is beautiful.
I am also very interested in software craftmanship, making high quality code and discovering what are the best design principles.
When you put these two interests together, it is no surprise that I am interested in writing websites that have cool graphs in them!</description>
